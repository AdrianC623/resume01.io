                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a determined individual with a deep passion for woodworking and making beautiful timeless pieces of art.
                    I have been a part of Arcadian Cottage for 12 years. Arcadian Cottage specializes in handmade furniture using reclaimed barn wood that is over 100 years old.
                    The specific wood we select is becoming rare as old barns and structures slowly disappear across the United States.
                    I believe that the only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary, and dont watch the clock keep going like it does.

                            I make all different types of furnishings from tables to butcher blocks, including custom orders.
                            I have experience using a variety of woodworking tools such as sanders, saws, planers, miter saws, and chisels.
